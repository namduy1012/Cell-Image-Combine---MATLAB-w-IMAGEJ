# Cell Movement Tracking Project with ImageJ & Matlab

## Overview
This project aims to facilitate the automatic combination of multi-slice two-dimensional (2D) images of cells. By utilizing these combined images, we can track the real-time movement of cells, providing insights and data crucial for numerous cellular studies.

## Features
- **Automatic Image Combination**: Seamlessly combine 2D multi-slice images to generate a comprehensive view of the cell movement.
- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor cell movement in real-time, enabling immediate observation and analysis.

## Tools Used

### Image Processing:
- **ImageJ**: A powerful open-source image processing tool tailored for scientific multidimensional images.

### Automation & Combination:
- **MATLAB**: Used for automating the combination process of the 2D images.

## Getting Started

1. **Install ImageJ**: Ensure you have [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/download.html) installed.
2. **Set Up MATLAB**: Ensure [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) is properly installed and configured.
3. **Clone this Repository**: Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
4. **Run the MATLAB Script**: Navigate to the directory containing the project's MATLAB script and run it. This will initiate the automatic combination process.
5. **Open Combined Image in ImageJ**: Post the combination process, open the resultant image in ImageJ for further analysis and real-time tracking.
